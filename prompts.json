        "user_message": "I’ve heard about growth mindset, but what does it actually mean in practice?",
        "bot_response": "A growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through effort, strategy, and help from others. It’s about focusing on learning over proving, and seeing challenges not as threats but as chances to grow."

        "user_message": "What are some daily habits that can help me strengthen my growth mindset?",
        "bot_response": "Begin with reflection: ask yourself what you learned today. Set a small, uncomfortable goal. Celebrate effort, not just outcomes. Track progress weekly and surround yourself with people who challenge you."

        "user_message": "My self-talk is really negative when I struggle. Can you help me improve it?",
        "bot_response": "Absolutely. Replace 'I’ll never get this' with 'I haven’t figured this out yet.' Turn 'I’m not good at this' into 'I’m learning something new.' Your mindset follows your language."

        "user_message": "I feel like I’m holding myself back with certain beliefs. How can I shift them?",
        "bot_response": "Start by identifying the belief and asking: Is this always true? Who would I be without it? Then, flip it to a growth-oriented version—like turning 'I’m too old to change' into 'I have experience to build from.'"

        "user_message": "I just got some tough feedback. How can I use it to grow instead of getting discouraged?",
        "bot_response": "Feedback is data—not a personal judgment. Ask yourself: What’s the truth in this? What’s one thing I can try differently? Growth-minded people seek feedback to get better, not to feel better."
